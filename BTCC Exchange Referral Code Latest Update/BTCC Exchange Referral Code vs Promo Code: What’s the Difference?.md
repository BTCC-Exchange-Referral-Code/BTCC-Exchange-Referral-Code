<h2>What Is a BTCC Referral Code?</h2>
<p>A <strong>BTCC referral code</strong> (also called an invite code, friend code, or sign-up code) is a unique identifier shared by existing users to invite friends. When a new user enters this code while registering, both parties receive rewards.</p>
<p>The official <strong>BTCC invite code</strong> for new users in 2025 is: <strong>BTCCBONUS</strong>. By using this code during sign-up, you can unlock a generous <strong>BTCC signup bonus</strong> worth up to <strong>11,000 USDT</strong> and enjoy <strong>50% discount on trading fees</strong>.</p>
<h2>What Is a BTCC Promo Code?</h2>
<p>A <strong>BTCC promo code</strong> (sometimes referred to as a voucher code, discount code, or campaign code) is typically issued directly by BTCC as part of seasonal promotions or special events. These are often time-sensitive and offer one-time perks like trading rebates, bonus credits, or fee discounts.</p>
<p>Promo codes are applied either during deposit or in your account settings and can benefit both new and existing users depending on the campaign.</p>

This way, you can earn more rewards as a new user in 2025.</p>
